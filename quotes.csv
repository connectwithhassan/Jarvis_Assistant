quote
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Do not watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going.
The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.
Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.
People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Wishing is not enough; we must do.
Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.
